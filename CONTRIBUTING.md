# Contributing to Abracadabra

First of all, we'd like to thank you for taking some of your time to contribute to the project. You're awesome ü§†üëç

## Getting started

> Pre-requisite: you have installed [git][install-git], [node][install-node] and [yarn][install-yarn].

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:nicoespeon/abracadabra.git`
1. Go into the cloned repository: `cd abracadabra`
1. Install dependencies:¬†`yarn install`

The project uses [TypeScript][typescript], [Jest][jest] for the tests and [Prettier][prettier] for the formatting.

## Run the tests

You can run tests with `yarn test`.

To run tests in watch mode, use `yarn test --watch`.

We use [Jest][jest] under the hood, so you can pass any valid Jest command to `yarn test`.

### About tests

In short, most of our tests are unit tests. We test business logic in isolation from VS Code API.

We don't have VS Code integration tests. [We've documented why in this ADR][adr-no-integration-tests].

## Create a new refactoring

Run `yarn new` and follow the tool, it will ask you the relevant questions.

[We've documented the context of this decision in this ADR][adr-create-generator].

If you want to change how code scaffolding works, check [hygen documentation][hygen-documentation].

You will also need to add the new refactoring to the lists in `package.json` and `src/extension.ts`. These lists should be kept in alphabetical order.

## Useful resources to start changing the code

- [VS Code Extension API documentation][vscode-extension-docs] is a good start
- [AST Explorer][ast-explorer] is a very handy tool to explore the AST. Use `babylon-7` parser.
- As we use Babel to transform the AST, [the handbook][babel-handbook] is very useful. In particular [the transformation][babel-handbook-transformation] and [the manipulation][babel-handbook-manipulation] parts.

## Code Style

Style formatting is managed by [Prettier][prettier]. It runs as a pre-commit hook, so you shouldn't have to worry about it üëê

There a few conventions that we'd like to keep consistent and are not automatically enforced yet.

### Structure of TS files

We structure TS files like this:

```ts
// 1. Imports from external libs
import { parse } from "@babel/parser";

// 2. Imports from local files
import { Selection } from "./selection";
import { Position } from "./position";

// 3. Exports
export { isStringLiteral, isClassDeclaration };
export { StringLiteral };

// 4. Rest of the code
function isStringLiteral() {
  // ‚Ä¶
}
```

As a general rule, we prefer to have **what is exposed appear before what is private**. That's why we list the exports at the top of the file. We find it simpler to see what is exposed from a file, so it's easier to decide if that's too much and we should split.

## Debug locally

You can use [VS Code's built-in debugger][vscode-debug-extension] on the project to test the extension.

To build the project, press `F5`.

![][debugger-build]

It will open an "Extension Development Host" window, overriding your "Abracadabra" extension with your local code. This is helpful to test your changes in integration with VS Code API.

![][extension-development-host]

If you do changes, rebuild the project by clicking on the reload icon.

![][debugger-rebuild]

While debugging the extension is helpful to see changes in action, you can use the unit tests to develop without having to rebuild the project at every change.

## Create a package and use it

To create a package from your local code, run `yarn package`.

When it's done, run `yarn package:install` to install this new version instead of the one you had.

This allows you to use the package before it's published to the MarketPlace.

## Open a PR and add acknowledge your contribution

You can open a Pull-Request at any time. It can even be a draft if you need to ask for guidance and help. Actually, we'd be pretty happy to assist you going in the best direction!

Once everything is ready, open a Pull-Request (if it's not already done) and ask for a review. We'll do our best to review it asap.

Finally, [use all-contributors bot command][all-contributors-bot-command] to add yourself to the list of contributors. It's very easy to do, you basically need to mention the bot in a comment of your PR.

Whether it's code, design, typo or documentation, every contribution is welcomed! So again, thank you very, very much üßô‚Äç
